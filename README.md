# Heart_Failure_Prediction
The major challenge in heart disease is its detection. There are instruments available which can predict heart disease but either it are expensive or are not efficient to calculate chance of heart disease in human. Early detection of cardiac diseases can decrease the mortality rate and overall complications. However, it is not possible to monitor patient’s every day in all cases accurately and consultation of a patient for 24 hours by a doctor is not available since it requires more sapience, time and expertise. Since we have a good amount of data in today’s world, we can use various machine learning algorithms using Python to analyze the data for hidden patterns. The hidden patterns can be used for health diagnosis in medicinal data.
